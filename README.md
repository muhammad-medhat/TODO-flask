## Getting Started
Following should be followed prior starting the project.

### Virtual Enviornment
It is recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

### Installing Dependencies
Only PIP Dependencies are required for this project. Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.
